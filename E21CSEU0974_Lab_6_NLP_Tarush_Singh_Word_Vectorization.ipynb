doctors reading practice confronted patient symptoms could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth eg fit profiles proyeast people identified consider antifungal therapy avenues exhausted remember theory practice two different things one without synergistic doctor something nonstandard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief thousand patients shouldnt least sit take notice maybe ought trust says

sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic antifungal sporanox exhausted avenues one traditional medical establishment able help natural thing went couple doctors somewhat outside establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapies hisher patients finally reach point accepted therapies ineffective id like hear doctor tell well ive tried therapies approved accepted country since clearly dont work authority use experimental unproven techniques seem helped others cant promise anything risks sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapies ill register case state board anyway ent suggested wouldve jumped pronto instead going one doctors either altruistic reasons greed practicing alternative therapies much risk himher risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable data would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system showing compassion medical community patient everything within

classified inspired held models effort find application situations practice ranges devotional reading sermons like exegesis canon ical scripture word god highest pitch leads question whether find inspired scripture something act absolute guidance actions problem finding lord commands going set aside essay one major direction christians looked commands namely christian tradition reject tradition primary audience essay protestants deny tradition determinative value favor witness scripture question want deal commandments find lord scripture turns hard question protestant inquisitors would like turn discussion authority tradition accomodate unlike protestants episcopalians admit claims scripture b reason c tradition roughly equal standing earlier john quote read john give new commandment love one another place nt christians given explicit commandment context commenting imperative mode pronouncement jesus meal readers infer since john synoptics jesus says take bread body mark cf matthew luke corinthians mode imperative greek labete hence commandment cases infer command directed wider circle immediate collocation disciples judge evangelists point mentioning disciples mostly entirely dead expected follow commandment lord case communion pauls mention least probably true evangelists also implies ongoing ritual liturgy words operate bind christians original command disciples continuing commandment christian community entirely comfortable inference must point us occasion jesus spoke command take clear inference least evangelists notion christians called love one another jesus command directed disciples call attention inference command apply without generalization specific context statement context disciple christ reading scripture make inferences get sense text whatsoever general problem reading texts read without understanding native languages normally read translated texts without appreciation original context points original languages english misleads us going presume follows general problem read scripture control dont really think true suffice current purposes address issues arise already coped understanding year old text another world one live questions level introduce reser vations commandments issue found stipulating read texts original audience might done among reasons seeing johns agapate allelou general commandment merely instruction jesus disciples one occasion one linking synoptic great commandment criticism jesus limiting love congenially associate matthew ff read learnt say love enemies fact leviticus context quoted say hate enemy merely common human presumption leviticus pains say love extend strangers amongst people israel luke expanding q context goes jesus say even sinners love love suggests quite strongly id say limiting scope new commandment quite jesus mind short inference leads generalizing actual text command force christians objects limited christians trickier agapate allelou institution communion case great commission matthew mark twelve sent evangelize proclaim kingdom heaven close hand verb imperative kerussete context rather specific twelve specifiers turn steps pagan territory enter samaritan town lukan parallels even specific jesus final journey jerusalem make harder see generalizing christians previous examples hasnt prevented christians making inference call attention inference justified text unlike first two cases cite rhetoric evangelist urged reader still paul seems felt obliged proclaim kingdom heaven close hand even contrary jesus instructions gentiles ends earth christians also taken commandment sense john accept dont know surely rather speculative see ripples inference spread text pretext christians may infer general commandment applicable presented gospels specific occasion necessarily object kind generalization insist people make must understanding reasoning considerable length actually scripture assumptions involved reasoning scriptural though people best justify assumptions references scripture simply adds inference mix lets move great commandment love god whole hearts minds souls perhaps synoptic equivalent johns agapate allelou yet presented commandment texts rather context controversy pharisees cite matthew ff pharisees heard silenced sadducees got together disconcert one put question master greatest commandment law means obvious though accept jesus answer meant commandment christians answering polemic enemies marks account casts answer far positive light scribe version says far important holocaust need point word originates context animal sacrifice forget nazis sacrifice luke intermediate lawyer posing question disconcert jesus gets good samarian parable pains luke contexts confusingly various one could forgiven drawing inferences account said obviously taken commandment binding christians though think entirely reasonable conclusion case jesus thinks point mental gears grind cycle get conclusion commanded jesus contingent understanding point jesus use torah quite different gospel accounts application context us different contexts among synoptics curious noted luke get fixing command parable good samaritan may look analogous intent matthew gives golden rule meaning law prophets may also hear echo hillel saying generation jesus make associations think entirely reasonable indulging inference texts explicitly support us rather read texts kind interrelationship current literary theory calls intertextuality discussion agapate allelou apply beyond community disciples beyound circle christian believers applies buttress conclusion despite presentation saying explicitly commandment christians christians would disagree conclusions must point conclusions depend rather elaborate chains reasoning simply present texts contextual problem keeps coming severely look sayings jesus universally taken christians commandments get really hard cases take divorce mark pretty clear man divorces wife marries another guilty adultery cf luke except matthew escape clause except case fornication seems rather clear commandment whether take matthews reservation christians day take dont least practice rather peculiar jesus explicit whereas says nothing things people gnash teeth possible commands christ clear matthew disagree evangelists synoptic tradition im going continue

xclients script logging actually took less time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works warner losh impsolbournecom provided good explanation works summarized start x server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process touches large number pages process running time would fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get sorted clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever x client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources fetched programs initializing state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically settles using pages using sleeps stagger launching clients xinitrc avoid fighting workstations limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently xinitrc situation like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive experimented sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm ive even tried sleep

client programs start quicker font already loaded server also conserve server resources since fewer fonts loaded server farrell mckay fbmptcburpptcbuozau joe english joetrysteroartcom eg main xterm

zechariah reads little differently lo king comes triumphant victorious humble riding ass ass colt command peace nations isnt much difference except zechariah involves one animal asscolt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthews version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier st mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt

record quite well might ask jesus matthew havent read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given gd messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthews pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked

assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiahking tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesuss time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better davids rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesuss time also made one must remember various factions among jews

yhvhs utterance lord sit right hand make enemies footstool yhvh sends forth mighty scepter zion rule midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings gd

throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said isnt lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potters field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potters field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah gd deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly gd would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthews quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariahs context whereas potters field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthews track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judass situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursdaynight bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthews work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would drink crucified divided garments among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet parted garments among upon vesture cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common sour wine type roman soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies

jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks gd damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive dont know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesuss drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings nd psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesuss clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesuss clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions nd psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning oh god cry day dont answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus doesnt much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesuss execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encircle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing im sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion kaari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word kaaru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalms true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce hands palms rather forearms doesnt say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples scars palms facts arent bound religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm like many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesuss life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious

matthews attempts matthew least usually excontexts one passage johns errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors

fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount st luke decides change things luke tells us lk one criminals hanged railed arent messiah
